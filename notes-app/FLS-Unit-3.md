# FIFA Player Analysis - Unit 3 Presentation

## Part 1: Left Midfielders vs Left Forwards Analysis

### Position Comparison Analysis
- Filtered dataset to LM and LF positions
- Used GGally for visualization
- Examined Acceleration and Agility metrics

### Statistical Analysis
#### 6-Step Hypothesis Test
1. **Hypotheses**
   - H₀: μLF - μLM = 0 (No difference in mean agility)
   - Ha: μLF - μLM ≠ 0 (There is a difference in mean agility)

2. **Assumptions**
   - Examined normality through histograms
   - Checked variance equality
   - Assessed independence

3. **Test Results**
   - T-test statistics and p-value
   - Effect size analysis
   - Confidence intervals

4. **Visual Evidence**
   - Distribution plots
   - Box plots
   - Scatter plots with trend lines

### Key Findings
- Relationship patterns between positions
- Statistical significance results
- Practical implications for player roles
